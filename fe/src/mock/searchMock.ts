It synthesizes foundational theory with empirical studies and replicable experiments to illustrate methodical reasoning and limitations. Special attention is given to recent advances, contested findings, and the implications of scaling the techniques to large, heterogenous datasets. The exposition balances formal proofs, measurement protocols, and guidelines for reproducibility aimed at graduate-level readers.",
